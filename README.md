# Complete AI & LLM Engineering Bootcamp

Welcome to the **Complete AI & LLM Engineering Bootcamp** – your one-stop course to learn Python, Git, Docker, Pydantic, LLMs, Agents, RAG, LangChain, LangGraph, and Multi-Modal AI from the ground up.

This is not just another theory course. By the end, you will be able to code, deploy, and scale real-world AI applications that use the same techniques powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### 📚 Foundations

- **Python programming** from scratch — syntax, data types, OOP, and advanced features
- **Git & GitHub** essentials — branching, merging, collaboration, and professional workflows
- **Docker** — containerization, images, volumes, and deploying applications like a pro
- **Pydantic** — type-safe, structured data handling for modern Python apps

### 🤖 AI Fundamentals

- What are LLMs and how GPT works under the hood
- Tokenization, embeddings, attention, and transformers explained simply
- Understanding multi-head attention, positional encodings, and the "Attention is All You Need" paper

### 💡 Prompt Engineering

- Master prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, persona-based prompts
- Using Alpaca, ChatML, and LLaMA-2 formats
- Designing prompts for structured outputs with Pydantic

### 🚀 Running & Using LLMs

- Setting up OpenAI & Gemini APIs with Python
- Running models locally with Ollama + Docker
- Using Hugging Face models and INSTRUCT-tuned models
- Connecting LLMs to FastAPI endpoints

### 🤖 Agents & RAG Systems

- Build your first AI Agent from scratch
- CLI-based coding agents with Claude
- The complete RAG pipeline — indexing, retrieval, and answering
- LangChain: document loaders, splitters, retrievers, and vector stores
- Advanced RAG with Redis/Valkey Queues for async processing
- Scaling RAG with workers and FastAPI

### 🧠 LangGraph & Memory

- Introduction to LangGraph — state, nodes, edges, and graph-based AI
- Adding checkpointing with MongoDB
- Memory systems: short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic memory
- Implementing memory layers with Mem0 and Vector DB
- Graph memory with Neo4j and Cypher queries

### 🎙️ Conversational & Multi-Modal AI

- Build voice-based conversational agents
- Integrate speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS)
- Code your own AI voice assistant for coding (Cursor IDE clone)
- Multi-modal LLMs: process images and text together

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- What is MCP and why it matters for AI apps
- MCP transports: STDIO and SSE
- Coding an MCP server with Python
